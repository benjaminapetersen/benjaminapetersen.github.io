# 9 Months With Polymer

My experience in short

## A Simple Element

Probably a contact card, that can later be expanded upon

## Bower?

At least set it up as a separate git repo with a build & dist that can be used.

Perhaps make a separate post on setting up a bower component

## Pulling this version

Will peg to a v.0.0.0 branch on the repo to pull this version, in case I expand on it in future posts.
